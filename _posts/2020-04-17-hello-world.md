It is March 17th and the world is being shaken by COVID-19, most industrialized countries are making something possible that until now wasn't: You don't have to drive back and forth to work in order to do work. 

For me, this takes getting used to. I have never worked 'remotely' before and it seems as if it will take time to separate between work and play. 

Recently I discovered a free and supposedly easy way to host a website, using GitHub. My workplace is not bleeding edge, and while I have heard a lot of buzz words, I never really used anything of them. I decided to try hosting a website, something which I had been wanting to do for a long time because every time I 'purposely' crash my lab, my notes also disappear. This is as good a time as any. Isnâ€™t it?

I have found myself following a lot of tutorials without really memorizing and / or learning what is happening, because who has the time. I am hoping through writing my process down, that it might help me remember and broaden my horizon. Also, I am trying to cut down on my Google-Fu time.
